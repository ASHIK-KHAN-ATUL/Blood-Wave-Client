## Overview
Blood Wave allows users to:
- Register and become donors
- Request blood from donors based on **location** and **blood group**
- Track the status of requests (pending, accepted, rejected, completed)

Donors can:
- Accept or reject blood requests
- Update personal information and donation status
- Track activity: pending requests, accepted, rejected, completed donations

Admins can:
- Monitor all users, donors, and requests
- View donation statistics via charts and analytics
- Track which donor gave blood to which user

**Donor Privacy:**  
If a donor sets `numberPublic: true`, users can see the **Call** and **Request** buttons; otherwise, only the request option is available.  

Once a donation is completed:
- Donor status becomes active again
- `lastDonation` date updates
- Total donation count increases
